Class - type that contains properties and associated methods

Object - instantiation of a class type

Handle - a reference to a class object

Class variable - a variable that holds class handle

This - object handle for the current object

Base class -  used in reference to another class that derives this class. A class becomes base class for another class
that derives from it to extend the functionality

Derived class - A class that derives from another class to extend the functionality

Parent/child class - if an object is instantiated inside another class then the instantiating class becomes the parent class and
the instantiated class becomes the child class

Inheritance - in inheritance, a class is extended to add functionality

Composition - in composition, a class instantiates another class to add functionality

Virtual class - class or a template class that cannot be instantiated but becomes a template for other classes to derive from

Abstract class - same as virtual class. Virtual  keyword is a means in SV to implement abstract class

concrete class - a class that can actually be instantiated. Opposite of abstract class

class specialization - a generic class for which types have been defined and is ready to create objects

Virtual function - methods that are subject to run time binding to achieve polymorphic behavior

Pure virtual function - a function that has no implementation but enforces concrete classes to implement them and give behavior

Upcasting/Downcasting - Upcasting is, assigning derived class handle to base class variable. Downcasting is, assigning base class handle to derived class variable. Downcasting is possible only under certain conditions and hence one has to use $cast in order to ensure type compatibility

Super - used to refer to base class

local - qualifier for a class property. The propery is visible in the class where it is declared. Not visible outside the class or the derived class

protected - qualifier for class property. The property is visible in the base and the derived class. Not visible outside the class

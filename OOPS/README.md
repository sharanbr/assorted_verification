OOPS is an important concept that every verification engineer has to know.
OOPS concepts have been extensively  used UVM itself.
In a way we, are using many of these, without probably realizing it.

Why is it important for a verification engineer to know OOPS?
Well, understanding of OOPS concepts will ensure that wera designing our testbenches that are robust (versus fragile) and re-usable for years. A fragile testbench is characterized by the fact that any addition of features needs modifications to the existing code.
A new feature will most likely need additonal code but in a robust testbench this can be achieved by adding additional code (versus modifying existing code).

A good example of robust code is UVM itself. UVM itself can be seen as a generic testbench.
It is very rarely that we find deficiencies in UVM when we are designing our own testbench. 
Why? TA lot of credit for this should go to OOPS that is exploited in SV

Some of the important OOPS concepts are - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritence & Encapsulation
The repository currently contains examples of Abstraction, Polymorphism. More code will be added later.

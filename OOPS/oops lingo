Class - type that contains properties and associated methods

Object - instantiation of a class type

Handle - a reference to a class object

Class variable - a variable that holds class handle

Base class -  used in reference to another class that derives this class. A class becomes base class for another class
that derives from it to extend the functionality

Derived class - A class that derives from another class to extend the functionality

Parent/child class - if an object is instantiated inside another class then the instantiating class becomes the parent class and
the instantiated class becomes the child class

Inheritance - in inheritance, a class is extended to add functionality

Composition - in composition, a class instantiates another class to add functionality

Virtual class - an abstract class or a template class that cannot be instantiated but becomes a template for other classes to derive from

Virtual function - methods that are subject to run time binding to achieve polymorphic behavior

Pure virtual function - a function that has no implementation but enforces concrete classes to implement them and give behavior

Polymorphism is an interesting and powerful concept within OOPS.
Many advanced and powerful verification components can be built, or rather need, polymorphism.
Understanding of polymorphism will help verificaiton engineers to build complex, highly scalable testbenches/testbench components.

The collection is code snippet that demonstrates how polymorphism behaves under different code constructs.

The excel indicates different cases that are depicted through example code.
The excel also highights how the function calls resolve for each of these case

Polymorphism is an interesting and powerful concept within OOPS.
Many advanced and powerful verification components can be built or rather need polymorphism.
Understanding of polymorphism will help verificaiton engineers to build complex testbenches or testbench components.

The collection is code snippet that demonstrates how polymorphism behaves under different code constructs.

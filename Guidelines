use 2 state variables when possible. For example, bit vs logic; int vs integer
New in UVM components should have 2 parameters - name and string
New in UVM components should not have default parameter values
Build method should call super.build as the first step
Avoid using protected or local variables for rand variables. This will create issues when using 
in-line constraints as these variables may not be visible outside the class
Follow infinity minus one approach for default constraints. That is, constraints should be loose by default

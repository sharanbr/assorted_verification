OOPS is an important concept that every verification engineer has to know.
OOPS concepts have been extensively been used UVM itself.
In a way we are using many of these without probably realizing it.

Why is it important for a verification engineer to know OOPS?
Well, understanding of OOPS concepts will ensure that wera designing our testbenches that are robust and re-usable for years.
A good example is UVM itself. UVM itself can be seen as a generic testbench.
It is very rare that we find deficiencies in UVM when we are designing our own testbench. 
Why? this is because of extensive use of OOPS

Some of the important OOPS concepts are - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritence & Encapsulation
The repository contains examples of Abstraction, Polymorphism

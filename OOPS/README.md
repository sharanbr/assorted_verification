OOPS is an important concept that every verification engineer should understand.
OOPS concepts have been extensively used UVM itself.
In a way we, are using many of these concepts, probably without realizing it.

Why is it important for a verification engineer to know OOPS?
Well, understanding of OOPS concepts will ensure that wera designing our testbenches that are robust (versus fragile) and re-usable for years. A fragile testbench is characterized by the fact that any addition of features needs modifications to the existing code.
A new feature will most likely need additonal code but in a robust testbench this can be achieved by adding additional code (versus modifying existing code).

A good example of robust code is UVM itself. UVM itself can be seen as a generic testbench.
It is very rarely that we find deficiencies in UVM when we are designing our own testbench. 
Why? A lot of credit for this should go to OOPS that is exploited extensively in SV

Some of the important OOPS concepts are - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritence & Encapsulation
The repository currently contains examples of Abstraction, Polymorphism. 
More examples to demonstrate OOPS concepts will be added ...
